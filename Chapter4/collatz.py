# Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print
# number // 2 and return this value. 
# If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.

# Then, write a program that lets the user enter an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1. 
# (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer; sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. 
# Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)

# Remember to convert the return value from input() to an integer with the int() function; otherwise, it will be a string value. 
# To make the output more compact, the print() calls that print the numbers should have a sep=' ' named parameter to print all values on one line.

# The output of this program could look something like this:
def collatz(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        result = number // 2
    else:
        result = 3 * number + 1
    print(result, end=' ')
    return result

print('Enter an number:')
user_number = int(input(''))

while user_number != 1:
    user_number = collatz(user_number)
