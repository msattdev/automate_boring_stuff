# Automate the Boring Stuff — Follow-along Notes ✅

This repository contains example scripts and exercises created while following *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart. The goal is to capture small, runnable examples chapter-by-chapter to practice Python basics and automation tasks.

---

## 🚀 Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.8+ installed (check with `python3 --version`).

Run an example script:

```bash
# From the repo root
python3 Chapter1/firstprogram.py
```

---

## 📁 Project structure

- `Chapter1/` — Chapter 1 examples (e.g., `firstprogram.py`)
- `README.md` — This file

---

## 💡 Example (what `firstprogram.py` does)

`firstprogram.py` is a simple interactive script that:

- Greets the user
- Asks for the user's name and age
- Prints the length of the name and the user's age next year

Run it and try entering different names and ages to see how input and string conversion work.
